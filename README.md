# Go Database Load Balancer

A simple distributed database using a [load-balancer](https://github.com/jamesstocktonj1/load-balancer-go/tree/main/load-balancer) node and a number of [database](https://github.com/jamesstocktonj1/load-balancer-go/tree/main/database) nodes. This is an introduction to docker and docker compose.


To run the project simply run docker compose: 
```
docker compose up -d --build
```

The architecture is as followed:

| Docker Name | IP | Port |
| --- | --- | --- |
| load-balancer | 10.5.0.10 | 3000 |
| database1 | 10.5.0.11 | 3001 |
| database2 | 10.5.0.12 | 3002 |
| database3 | 10.5.0.13 | 3003 |
| database4 | 10.5.0.14 | 3004 |

## Performance
The performance can be measured using the [db-test](https://github.com/jamesstocktonj1/load-balancer-go/tree/main/db-test) program. Results are as followed:
